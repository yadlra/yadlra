### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ethical projects around software and datasets. As part of my Fellowship with the Software Sustainability Institute, I am planning sessions and workshops on artefacts creation that prompt conversations, imaginaries and action points for software creativity that takes nto account our ecosystems, social spaces and justice.
## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use data science tools with art and joy in mind.
## ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects, visions that want oppressive systems replaced for liberatory and joyful systems of life.
