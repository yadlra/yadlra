### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ethical projects around software and datasets. As part of my Fellowship with the Software Sustainability Institute, I am planning sessions and workshops on artefacts creation that prompt conversations, imaginaries and action points for software creativity. Centering our ecosystems life, social spaces and justice.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use data science tools with art and joy in mind.
- ðŸ‘¯ Forever collaborating on any projects and visions that centre liberation, joy and life and the immensity of art in our cosmos.
