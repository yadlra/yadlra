### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I enjoy doing work on critical justice based projects around technology. I co-organise sessions and workshops on artefacts creation that prompt conversations, imaginaries and action points for technological creativity by centering our ecosystems, social spaces and liberation movements.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use hardware tools with art and joy in mind.
- ðŸ‘¯ Forever collaborating on any projects and visions that centre liberation, joy and life and the immensity of art in our cosmos.
